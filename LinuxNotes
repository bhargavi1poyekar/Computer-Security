Linux is OS-> free and open source.
Kernel=> which is interface between h/w and s/which

Many Linux distributions=> ubuntu, kali, debain, centos

Linux runs on all kinds of H/w platforms

Stable, relaible, secure

Great for servers

Linux in cyber security=> penetration test, vulnerability scans.

Linux directories:

/ => Root directory
/bin => binaries and other executable programs
/etc => system configuration files
/home => home directories
/opt => optional or 3rd party software
/tmp => temporary space, typically cleared on reboot
/usr => user related programs
/var => variable data, mostly log files

------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Commands:

ls => list directories
pwd => print working directory
cat <filename> => shows the content of the file
echo "<statement>" => Acts as print => prints whatever is in the quotes
help, man <command name> => shows the manual of the command

man => inside manual
    => move to next page=> press space
    => move to top of the page => press g
    => quit manual = press q
    => move to bottom of page => G

touch <filename> => Creates a new file in the directory
rm <filename> => deletes file

exit => closes the terminal 
type -a <command name> tells the location of that command and also tells if it is shell built-in. if it is, then we can use help on it. Help doesnt work for commands which are not shell built in

-------------------------------------------------------------
Directory commands:

cd => goes to home directory
cd <child_directory>=> change directory => goes to child (goes down 1 directory down the heirarchy)
cd .. => come back to parent (go back 1 directory up heirarchy)
cd - => goes back 1 directory and also tells where we are now
mkdir <foldername> => Create new directory => if want to create multiple dir at a time, use space between directorynames . eg: mkdir bhargavi arya

rmdir <foldername> => removes directory

rm -rf <foldername> => deletes directory and its content => you need to be in the parent directory of this directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ls command:

ls -a => lists all files including the hidden files
ls -l => shows all the files in a long format with their permissions and more info like date and time
ls -r => list the files in descending order (alphabetically)
ls -t => sort by time

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

File permissions:

permission types => 
        => r => read
        => w => write
        => x => execute

Eg:

-rw-rw-r--
=> first dash => represents current file => it is d if it is a folder or l if link
=> first rw- => current user
=> middle rw => belong to group permission
=> last r => others

Change permissions:

UGOA => U for user, G=> group, O=> other, A=> All
+-= => + add permission, - subtract permission, = set all
rwx => read , write, execute

eg:

chmod ugo=r <filename> => changed all permissions to r => converts to -r-r-r--
chmod u+x <filename>=> add x permission to user

chmod 700 <filename> => rwx to user, everything else=> nothing

chmod 755 <filename> => -rwxr-xr--x   (mostly use this)

chmod 664 <filename> => -rw-rw-r-- 

chmod 660 => -rw-rw-----

chmod 644 => -rw-r-r----

chmod 777 => gives all permissions to all (avoid)

chmod 666 => gives rw permission to all users
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find => check if a file even exists in this directory 

find . -name <filename>

find . -name <filename> => case insensitive

find . -mtime 7 => 7 days old file

find . -size 0 => files with size 0

find . -newer <filename> files newer than given file
